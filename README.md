# Spotify_Api_Testing
Test Spotify API endpoints, using POSTMAN.

------------------------------

Current issues:
	- Environment variable naming (keys) needs to be standardized so that they will run accross all test suites
	- Postman environment variable template needs to be uploaded to git
	- Test suits need to be modified on both contribuitor's end so that they will accept the standardized key names
